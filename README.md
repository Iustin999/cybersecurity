| [MD5 File Integrity Checker](https://github.com/Iustin999/cybersecurity/tree/main/projects/integrity-md5-checker) | This project demonstrates a simple and educational Python application used to verify the integrity of .txt files by comparing their MD5 hash values. Developed as a student project, the tool calculates the digital fingerprint (hash) of a selected file and compares it with a user-provided reference value. | [PDF RO](https://github.com/Iustin999/cybersecurity/blob/main/projects/integrity-md5-checker/MD5-security.pdf) | ![preview](https://github.com/Iustin999/cybersecurity/blob/main/projects/integrity-md5-checker/hashing.png) | [AES Message Encryptor](https://github.com/Iustin999/cybersecurity/tree/main/projects/AES%20Message%20Encryptor) | A simple command-line Python app that encrypts and decrypts messages using AES-CBC, with a secure key derived from a passphrase via SHA-256. | [PDF EN](https://github.com/Iustin999/cybersecurity/blob/main/projects/integrity-md5-checker/MD5-security.pdf) | ![preview](https://github.com/Iustin999/cybersecurity/blob/main/projects/AES%20Message%20Encryptor/5.png) |
